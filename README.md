## What does it do?

This web application uses Firebase to host arrival and departure data for various trains.  The app allows users to input the trains and respective schedules that are useful to them to monitor the specific various trains they utilize in their commute.  By showing current time, arrival times for all trains, and minutes until departure, commuters have the needed insight to plan exactly how long they'll have between catching trains.
